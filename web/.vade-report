## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project using the App Router.

### Changes Made:

**1. Installed Package**
   - Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
   - Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
   - Updated `package-lock.json` with resolved dependencies

**2. Modified Files**
   - **app/layout.tsx** (Root Layout):
     - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
     - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag after `<ScoreProvider>{children}</ScoreProvider>`

### Implementation Details:

The project uses Next.js 14.2.35 with the App Router pattern (not the legacy Pages Router). The implementation follows Vercel's recommended approach:

1. The Analytics component is imported from `@vercel/analytics/next`, which is the correct import path for App Router projects
2. The component is placed inside the `<body>` tag in the root layout, ensuring it's available across all pages
3. Placement is after the ScoreProvider component to ensure proper context hierarchy

### Verification:

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ No linting issues introduced
✅ All dependencies properly installed and locked
✅ Project builds to production with routes and static generation working correctly

### Files Changed:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated lock file with new dependency
