Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js project as requested.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) using npm package manager
- Updated package.json with the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect the installation

### 2. Analytics Integration
- Modified `app/layout.tsx` (Root Layout - App Router):
  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after `<ScoreProvider>{children}</ScoreProvider>`
  - Placed correctly within the JSX structure to ensure proper loading

### 3. Verification
- ✅ npm build: Completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ All pages compiled correctly (7 pages generated)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors introduced
- ✅ Project structure preserved - only necessary changes added

## Implementation Details:

The project uses:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.0 with App Router (app directory)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Language**: TypeScript

The Analytics component was added to the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) which is the appropriate location for the App Router pattern. The component will automatically track analytics for all pages in the application without requiring any additional configuration.

## Files Modified:
1. `web/app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
2. `web/package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
3. `web/package-lock.json` - Updated with dependency lock information
